# St.-Patrick-s-Day/Spring-Web-Page

The premise of this project is to allow you to showcase the skills which you have learned over the last week with respect to PHP and MySQL. 

Your goal is to create a web page or site which has a St. Patrick's Day/Spring theme, utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL, and incorperates the material from the lessons we have learned over the last two weeks. Think back to aliensabductedme.com and makemeelvis.com. 

You may use the code we have already created from these two practice projects.

You don't necessarily have to sell something, but your site should have a clear purpose. 

You can draw from any site you have created in this class or others. 

This should only take you one class period to complete. It is just a fun way to end out the quarter and to welcome the spring season.
